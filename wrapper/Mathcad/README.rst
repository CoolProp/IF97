Wrapper of IF97 for PTC Mathcad Prime (and Legacy Mathcad)
================================================

This wrapper will provide Custom Functions (User Defined) in Mathcad Prime (or Legacy Mathcad) that provide thermodynamic and transport properties for water/steam at specified state points based on the 1997 IAPWS Industrial Formulation for the Properties of Water and Steam.  While these properties can also be accessed through the CoolProp add-in, this wrapper provides **_only_** these steam/water properties without the overhead of CoolProp.

This wrapper been developed and tested on Mathcad Prime 3.0 through 7.0 and Legacy Mathcad 15.0 (any maintenance release).  It **_may_** work on earlier versions of Mathcad and Mathcad Prime, but it has not been tested there.

------

To Use (Overview)
======

* Build the Add-in DLL in VS2008 or later using the build instructions below.

* Install the Add-in files by copying them to the appropriate Mathcad Prime (or Legacy Mathcad) Installation directories as indicated below.  

* View ``if97_verification.pdf`` or ``if97_verification_IAPWS.pdf`` for examples of using the functions.

------

To Build
========

Follow the build procedures below to ceate the IF97 add-in DLL files for either Mathcad 15 or Mathcad Prime.

Pre-Requisites
--------------

* You will need to have at least Visual Studio 2008 installed (Express version is fine).  Alternatively newer versions of Microsoft Visual Studio C++ should be fine; Builds have be tested on Visual Studio 2010, 2015, 2017, and 2019.
* You will need CMake version 2.8.12 or later from https://cmake.org/download/
* You will need to install Git-SCM for Windows.  You can install this from https://git-for-windows.github.io

Download the IF97 Repository
----------------------------

* Open a Git window at the drive location where you want to create your local IF97 repository

* Clone the CoolProp/IF97 repository to a local repository (If you haven't already cloned it recursively with CoolProp).::

    git clone https://github.com/CoolProp/IF97

* Change directory (cd) to the IF97 directory you just created.::

    cd IF97

Make the Build for Mathcad Prime (any version above 3.0)
--------------------------------

* Go to the top level IF97 directory and make a build directory (something like \buildPrime)::

    mkdir buildPrime
    cd buildPrime

* Build the makefile using CMake (Note: Mathcad Prime is 64-bit)::

    cmake .. -DIF97_PRIME_MODULE=ON 
             -DIF97_PRIME_ROOT="C:/Program Files/PTC/Mathcad 7.0.0.0"  
             -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" 
             -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON 
	     
	     (Insert your version of Visual Studio for the -G option.)
	     (Note that Prime is 64-bit and requires the Win64 switch on this command)

Make the Build for Legacy Mathcad 15 (Discontinued by PTC)
-----------------------------

* Go to the top level IF97 directory and make a build directory (something like \build15)::

    mkdir build15 
    cd build15

* Build the makefile using CMake (Note: Mathcad 15 is 32-bit)::

    cmake .. -DIF97_MATHCAD15_MODULE=ON 
             -DIF97_MATHCAD15_ROOT="C:/Program Files (x86)/Mathcad/Mathcad 15"  
             -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" 
             -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON 
	     
	     (Insert your version of Visual Studio for the -G option.)

Build the Project
-----------------

* Open the resulting IF97.sln file in Visual Studio and build the IF97 project, making sure that ``Release`` configuration is selected in the VS menu toolbar and that the platform is set to ``x64`` for use with Mathcad Prime (64-bit).  Alternatively, you can build the dynamic library (DLL) from the command line using cmake::

    cmake --build . --config Release
  
------
  
Installing
==========

* Build the IF97 DLL as indicated above and then copy the wrapper files to the appropriate Mathcad 15 or Prime directories as follows.

Mathcad Prime (v3.0 or higher)
----------
* Copy the ``Release\IF97.dll`` file to ``C:\Program Files\PTC\Mathcad Prime 7.0.0.0\Custom Functions`` or equivalent for your version of Mathcad Prime.
  
Legacy Mathcad 15 (Discontinued)
----------
* Copy the ``Release\IF97.dll`` file to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Mathcad\Mathcad 15\userefi`` or equivalent for your version of Mathcad.    
* **Legacy Mathcad Only:** Copy the ``IF97_EN.xml`` to ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Mathcad\Mathcad 15\doc\funcdoc``.  Functions and descriptions will then be available in the Mathcad 15 interface under Insert|Function or the Functions button on the toolbar.  This functionality is **_still_** not available in Mathcad Prime as of version 8.0.

Compiler Flags
==============
The Mathcad wrapper code uses the ``REGION3_ITERATE`` flag to provide more accurate (but slightly slower) calculation of density in Region 3 (mostly super-critical), but does **_not_** use the ``IAPWS_UNITS`` flag, leaving all input/output values in SI units.
